This is for practicing code for review and so I have notes on where to get better.

MY Notes:
DIFF BETWEEN VARS, LET AND CONST
var:  *globally scoped. 
        *if  declared inside a code block, it can't be accessed outside of it. However if declared out side, it can be accessed within a code block.
        * doesn't get hoisted at start.

let: *locally scoped
        *can't redeclare within same scope
        * can be redeclared in different scopes  (differnt code blocks)
        * doesn't get hoisted to start
